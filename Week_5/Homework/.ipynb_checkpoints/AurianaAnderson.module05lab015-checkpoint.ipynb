    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is versatile and general purpose program. It has a rich and extensive ecosystem utilizing third party programs, adiing on to its functionality. This is one of my favorite parts about it, is that you can integrate it with different programs. Another point that I continually saw was that it has such a wide varitey of libraries and since it is well established, it also has a huge support system and community. This makes doing things in python easier and you have a lot of support from its community if you need help resolving issues. Another great thing about it, is that the language is fairly simple and easy to lear, therefore making it user friendly.\n",

    "Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-language-advantages-applications/\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages: One disadvanatage that I saw was that once code starts to get more complex, python can use a lot of memory. This can slow down processes in a work place. Another thing that I saw was that it lacks strictness, meaning that sometimes it can be too flexibile causing code to be created which can be hard to interpret. Variables don't necessarily have to be declared which can make it hard for someone coming in on a project. One last important point I saw was that It has  a Global Interpreter Lock which limits one task to execute python code at a time. This means you can have multiple threads running in your python program but one can only be actively running. I found this interesting because most computers these days are multi-cored but you wouldn't necessarily be able to multi-task with python regardless. \n",

    "Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-language-advantages-applications/\n",
    "\n",
    "Why its popular:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is popular because of its simplicity. I also saw numerous times that you can be more efficient with python because you can do more with less with pythons syntax. This cuts down on time you might have with other \"tedious\" languages where you may have to follow a stricter syntax. Again, as pointed out earlier, its well established, it has extensive libraries, and an extensive community. This means there are a lot of resources on it and if you need help, you are likely able to get help quickly with one of the many forums out there. It was also mentioned that it is widely used in academia and some students have started learning it as early as elementary school. \n",
